### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Checkout Refactoring (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal:** Break down the monolithic checkout page into maintainable components

## Refactoring Plan

### Analysis Phase (Current)
- Identify state management logic
- Map component sections
- Extract reusable utilities
- Plan component hierarchy

### Implementation Phase (Next)
1. Create component directory structure
2. Extract shared types and interfaces
3. Extract utility functions and hooks
4. Create sub-components:
   - CheckoutStepper
   - ShippingStep
   - PaymentStep (with sub-components)
   - ReviewStep
5. Update main checkout page to orchestrate

## Next Steps
1. Complete checkout page analysis
2. Begin component extraction
3. Test thoroughly after each extraction
4. Update documentation

## Notes
- Maintaining all existing functionality
- No UI/UX changes - only code organization
- Preserve all payment flow logic
- Keep state management patterns consistent
